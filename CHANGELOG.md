	<li>
		Restructured a whole lot of the code, so its a little bit less of a mess... (Even though this is the modules name! :P )
	</li>
	<li>
	Removed the default 5e context menu for applying damage, since this resulted in unwanted and confusing behaviour. I will revisit this for the next patch and add <em>some</em> option to apply damage using the rolls. I'm just not sure currently as to how i want to tackle this. Feel free to add ideas to the <a href="https://github.com/Moerill/Mess/issues/9">issue</a>.
