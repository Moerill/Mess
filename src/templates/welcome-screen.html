<h1>Very Important!</h1>
<P><b>This update removes Mess rolling modifications for 5e.</b> (For everyone else nothing changes)!</p>
<p>If you liked those changes, do not fear, i reworked them and put them into its own module, with improved design, features, code base, ...! <em>The new module is called <a href="https://github.com/Moerill/fvtt-mars-5e">Mars 5e</a>.</em></p>
<p>It is not the same as MESS, but its the way i wanted to go and keep going. Its still missing automatic rolling, but this feature is planned for the next big(ger) update.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: right;">Best regards, <br>Moerill</p>
